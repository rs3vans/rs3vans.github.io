I love to write software - I find the entire process very interesting and rewarding.
As such, I'm constantly pushing myself to become a better software engineer.

I've been writing software for the better part of 16 years, and professionally for 10 of those.
I currently work at [The Nerdery](http://nerdery.com) (KC) as a Principle Software Engineer in the JVM discipline.
The majority of my professional experience has been in Java, but I've also worked in JavaScript, Python, Clojure,
Scala, Groovy, and Ruby (among others).

Aside from coding, I love being a dad, a husband, and a long-distance runner :)
